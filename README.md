# The Toss application
Have you received a link via text, but you want to follow up on a computer?

**Toss** (AKA **TossToSelf**) is an app that sends small snippets of text (not necessarily links) from one device to another, as long as they are on the same network (WiFi or wired). It's not an Internet messenger and won't ever be.
It is slated to be available for the two major mobile platforms and the three major desktop ones (check their respective app stores):

* [Toss on Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9PH1STQKFP46 )
* [Toss on Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tosstoself/id6744201613_)
* [Toss on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.tosstoself.toss)
* Toss for Linux (x86-64):
  * [DEB package for APT based distros](https://toss.jishop.com/toss_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb)
  * [RPM package for RedHat derived distros](https://toss.jishop.com/toss-1.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm)
  * [ZST package for Pacman distros](https://toss.jishop.com/toss-1.0.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst)

The homepage is for now at [toss.jishop.com](https://toss.jishop.com/)
