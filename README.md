# The Toss application
Have you received a link via text, but you want to follow up on a computer?

**Toss** (AKA **TossToSelf**) is an app that sends small snippets of text (not necessarily links) from one device to another, as long as they are on the same network (WiFi or wired). It's not an Internet messenger and won't ever be.
It is slated to be available for the two major mobile platforms and the three major desktop ones (check their respective app stores):

* [Toss on Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9PH1STQKFP46 )
* [Toss on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.tosstoself.toss)

Other flavors to be published shortly.

The homepage is for now at [toss.jishop.com](https://toss.jishop.com/) 

## Usage
Run Toss on the phone and on the computer, find the device name in the list, type or paste the message, and click Send.
